# Patch: Regenerate Prisma Client After Job Queue Migration

## Metadata
adw_id: `bc4f9d05`
review_change_request: `Prisma Client generation out of sync - generated client at node_modules/.prisma/client/schema.prisma reflects old schema without job queue fields, causing validation errors when attempting to create jobs with jobStatus.`

## Issue Summary
**Original Spec:** specs/issue-18-adw-bc4f9d05-sdlc_planner-background-job-queue.md
**Issue:** Database schema migration has been applied successfully, adding job queue fields (jobStatus, progress, currentStep, processedAt, lastHeartbeat, priority) to NewsletterGeneration model. However, the generated Prisma Client in node_modules/.prisma/client still reflects the old schema without these fields, causing TypeScript validation errors and runtime failures when attempting to create or query jobs with jobStatus.
**Solution:** Regenerate Prisma Client using `npx prisma generate` to synchronize the generated client with the current database schema, then restart the application to load the updated client.

## Files to Modify
- node_modules/.prisma/client/ (regenerated by Prisma CLI)

## Implementation Steps
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Regenerate Prisma Client
- Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate client from current schema.prisma
- Verify command output shows "Generated Prisma Client" with updated NewsletterGeneration model including job queue fields

### Step 2: Restart Application
- Run `docker-compose restart app` to reload application with updated Prisma Client
- Verify application starts without errors in logs

## Validation
Execute every command to validate the patch is complete with zero regressions.

- `npx prisma generate` - Regenerate Prisma Client from schema
- `docker-compose restart app` - Restart application to load updated client
- `npm run lint` - Verify TypeScript type checking passes
- `npm run build` - Verify Next.js build completes successfully

## Patch Scope
**Lines of code to change:** 0 (code generation only)
**Risk level:** low
**Testing required:** Verify TypeScript compilation and application startup succeed
